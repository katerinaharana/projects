# Call Center Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes call center performance data to evaluate both **agent performance** and **daily call center operations**. By examining key metrics such as call handling efficiency, satisfaction ratings, and agent-specific performance, it identifies opportunities for improvement and trends in customer service.

## Features
### 1. **Agent Performance Analysis**
   - Tracks the number of agents working each day.
   - Analyzes average calls handled per agent.
   - Breaks down performance metrics by agent.

### 2. **Daily Call Center Analysis**
   - Number of answered and missed calls per day.
   - Percentage of calls lost.
   - Trends in customer satisfaction ratings and average talk durations.

### 3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   - Customer satisfaction scores.
   - Average talk durations.
   - Percentage of lost calls.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
